Set 'wildignore' from git repo root.
Adapted from gitignore <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2557&gt; by Adam Bellaire.

This plugin is designed to complement CtrlP.
There is no easy way to:
1. Restrict search results to files under current directory
2. Honor .gitignore in repo root
at the same time.

Adam Bellaire's script honors .gitignore when Vim is opened at repo root, but not when Vim is opened in subfolders under repo root.

If this plugin is present, when you cd foo/bar/ and open Vim, and suppose foo/.gitingore ignores _*, CtrlP ignores foo/bar/_build and all results are under foo/bar/.
